/// controller is actually present - it does no PCI probing itself.

/// call will surface NvmeInitError::NoController, mapped to
/// BlockError::NotReady, exactly like every other lazy-init path in
/// this codebase (ensure_admin_queue() etc.). This keeps hal::init()
/// itself simple and matches the registry's Option-based design,
/// which is meant to degrade gracefully when a device class is absent.
